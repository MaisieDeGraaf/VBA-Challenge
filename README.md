# VBA-Challenge
VBA_Module_Final.bas contains all VBA code, along with a Word document titled sub Stockticker if the .bas file is not working. A copy of the alphabetical testing is also included, as the original Excel sheet for the stocks are too large to upload to Github. It is tested and runs on the larger Excel sheet as well.
Screenshots include Stock_Output_1, Stock_Output_2, Stock_Output_3, which are pictures of the final output for the larger sheet, and Stock_Output_4 is a picture of the code in VBA.
